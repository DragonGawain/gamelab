WAVES:
Idea: 
Each wave gets progressively more difficult
Each wave, we randomly assign a few enemies to be void hole spawning enemies
Void enemies will have a different color ()(can just be a tint if we don't have time to make new textures)
Void enemies will have more HP (double?)
Enemies spawn as the wave goes on, not all at once
